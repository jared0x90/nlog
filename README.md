This is my simple open source blog project to learn about Node.js, git, 
express, ejs and MongoDB. I may incorporate other technologies into this
project as well and as I see fit.

This was written on Ubuntu 12.10.

From a fresh VM install the following:

apt-get install nodejs
apt-get install npm

Clone or Fork the project from github then run npm install in the root of the 
workspace to setup the express and ejs frameworks.
